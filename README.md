# CodeHive
CodeHive is a Java-based repository that focuses on LeetCode problem solutions. It offers a categorized approach to organizing solutions based on the problem types, such as binary search, tree, and more. The repository serves as a resource for me and other Java developers looking for efficient and well-structured solutions to LeetCode problems.

1. Browse the repository to find the specific problem category or type you are interested in.
2. Within each problem category, locate the specific LeetCode problem you want to solve.
3. Open the corresponding Java file containing the solution code.
4. Copy the code from the file.
5. Paste the code into the LeetCode platform to test it against the provided test cases for the problem.
6. Make any necessary modifications or adjustments to the code as needed for your specific implementation requirements.

Usage:

**Please note that the repository does not include test cases, as they should be copied and run on the LeetCode platform directly.**

Copy the solution and run in LeetCode

``` java
// Binary Search Problem: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
class ProblemName {
    public int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Solution implementation
    }
}
```
